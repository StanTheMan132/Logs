# Logs

### What is this?

In this repo I am going to post different writeups about my code projects both as a way to track my progress as wel as being a place to reflect on my work

### RULES

For others who want to try this as wel as to hold my self accountable I have created a few rules. Try to follow these rules as best you can

1. Any log created may not be edited after a day, this to to prevent going back after a year and making yourself look smarter and prevent really showing what you knew at that time and progress.
2. A log must be created when you make a new repo, try explain your goals possible chalanges and motivation as best you can.
3. A log must be created when you delete a repo, try explain what went wrong
4. A log must be created when making large edits to a project however regulary creating logs is preffered
5. Name your logs as mentioned in *structure* incase I ever create a website or program for these logs

### STRUCTURE
A folder will be created for each year, inside that folder will be another folder for each month. The logs will be placed in here. The logs will be named simply the date (dd/mm/yyyy). 

Ex:

* Logs repo
  * 2017
    * JULY
      * 20/07/2017.md
